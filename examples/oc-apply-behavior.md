# What Happens When You Run `oc apply` on an Already Deployed Resource?

When you run `oc apply -f file.yaml` on a resource that already exists in OpenShift, the result depends on whether the YAML content is different from the current state in the cluster. Here are the possible scenarios:

---

## 🔄 Scenario 1: No Changes in the YAML

- **Result**: OpenShift detects no differences.
- **Effect**: Nothing changes. No pods are restarted or reconfigured.
- **Message**: You might see something like:
  ```
  deployment.apps/my-app configured (unchanged)
  ```

---

## ✏️ Scenario 2: Changes in Fields Managed by `oc apply`

- **Examples**: Changes in labels, replica counts, resource limits, environment variables, image versions, etc.
- **Result**: OpenShift applies the changes.
- **Effect**:
  - A rolling update may occur (for Deployments).
  - Pods might restart if a mounted ConfigMap or Secret changed.

---

## 🛑 Scenario 3: Changes to Immutable Fields

- **Examples**: Changing a `selector`, persistent volume type, or `clusterIP` in a `Service`.
- **Result**: OpenShift returns an error, as some fields are immutable.
- **Message**: You might see:
  ```
  The Service "my-service" is invalid: spec.clusterIP: Invalid value: "": field is immutable
  ```

---

## 💣 Scenario 4: Invalid YAML Syntax or Structure

- **Result**: OpenShift cannot process the file.
- **Message**: The CLI shows a validation error:
  ```
  error: error validating "file.yaml": error validating data: ValidationError(...)
  ```

---

## 💡 Pro Tip: Dry-Run Before Applying

To simulate applying changes without making any actual modifications:

```bash
oc apply --dry-run=server -f file.yaml
```

This helps you check for changes or errors ahead of time.
